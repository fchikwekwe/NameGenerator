# name-ly

Welcome to name-ly! Yes, this app generated its own name!

I'll take your through a short quiz and give you a list of awesome, unique names. Whether you're at a loss while creating a Dungeons and Dragons character, or if you're looking for some unique options to name your child, give it a try at https://name-ly.herokuapp.com/.

### If you're here to see how I'm developing this app, check out 'notes.md' for my development plan.

## Current Features
Right now, this app generates human/fantasy names. You answer three short questions on the homepage and you'll be presented with a list of name options. If you don't like those names, hit the 'More Names' button for a new list or retake the quiz for different options.

You can save the names to your profile by logging in or signing up!

## How does it work?
The name generator is run by the name-ly API (https://github.com/fchikwekwe/name-ly-API). This is a companion microservice that I developed. It dynamically adds and removes names from a corpus and runs those names through a Markov chain, providing you with unique names every time.

## Testing
[WIP] Mocha and Chai were used for testing. To run tests for this project, type the command 'mocha' or 'npm test' into your console from the root folder.

## Running
If you've cloned the repo, this project can be run locally at http://localhost:3000/. To check it out, type the command 'npm start' into your console from the root folder. The current, live version of name-ly can be accessed here: http://name-ly.herokuapp.com/.

## Future Development
Continued development on this project will be ongoing. For a list of current tasks and potential future features, check out notes.md.
